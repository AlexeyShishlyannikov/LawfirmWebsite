            <p>Bankruptcy is a legal process in a federal bankruptcy court that relieves individuals of some or all of their
              consumer debt. Generally, a government appointed trustee assesses the debtorâ€™s assets and liabilities and determines
              which of the assets or property the debtor is allowed to retain and which, if any, must be liquidated in ordered
              to pay as many qualifying debts as possible. Residual debts are discharged, with the exception of certain types,
              such as domestic support orders, most tax debt, and debt obtained by fraud. The goal of bankruptcy law is to
              provide qualified individuals and businesses with a fresh start to become productive and financially independent.</p>
            <p>Filing a bankruptcy petition will stop any pending foreclosure, garnishment, repossession or bank levy. Call
              now to see if you qualify for bankruptcy filing.</p>
